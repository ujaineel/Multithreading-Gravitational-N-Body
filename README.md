# Parallel-N-Body-Gravitational-Simulation
N-Body Gravitational Simulation that is parallelized with the use of OpenMP library in C++

To run code, compile gifmerge and nBody (with g++ -fopenmp nBody.cpp -o nBody) and then, run runpsim.sh with ./runpsim.sh <Num. of Particles> <Num. of Timesteps> to visualize the particles.
